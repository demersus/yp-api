SO I ordered a piece of Pesto Primo pizza ( my favorite) sat down grabbed a magazine and oh man was that pizza good, I actually saw my bus pull up and drive away and didn't care.

Just left my mothers and wanted not to cook so we stopped by on the way home at the store on 9th and 85th. Stood in the store and made eye contact with 6 different persons working and chatting for 8 minutes before we walked out and went to Subway. Everyone was too occupied to even ask if they could help us. My husband and I were in nice professional work clothes and in our fifties. We won't be back. Snoose Junction just got another new customer.   ","reviewDate":"2009-12-15 03:19:10 +0000","reviewSubject":"too busy to wait on customers","reviewer":"1petersoF"}]}}}
